# The HTML Smuggling Phishing Attack

In this episode of The DFIR Chronicles, cyber-investigator Dylan Log, analyst Cyra Neuron, and forensic prodigy Byte dive into a seemingly ordinary email investigation â€” one that quickly spirals into a dangerous web of deception.

The team is called in after a client forwards a suspicious EML file. Inside, an innocuous-looking HTML attachment hides a sophisticated phishing attack using HTML Smuggling, a technique designed to bypass email gateways and endpoint protections. Buried beneath layers of obfuscated JavaScript, they uncover base64-encoded URLs, anti-debugging traps, and code designed to steal Microsoft 365 credentials through clever browser redirection.

As Dylan deciphers the smuggled payload, Cyra traces the behavioral fingerprints, and Byte dissects the layers of misleading code, the team must piece together the attacker's intent before others fall victim.

This case isn't just about catching malware, it's about confronting a modern adversary who hides behind code, misdirection, and psychological manipulation. And in a world where the line between user error and engineered deception grows thinner by the day, The DFIR Chronicles remind us: the truth is always in the logs.
